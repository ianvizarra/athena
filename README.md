# No startup experience required.

You can participate in the program whilst studying or working

# Startups are not risky.

Everyone we know who's worked 10 years on building startups is making at least $500,000 USD in profit. Startups fail because people quit.
<br/>

It takes 10 years to be a doctor, 10 years to be a lawyer, 10+ years to get good at any anything. It's the same with being a founder, but your upside is uncapped.

# The most actionable startup curriculum ever

100+ resources compiled into a 12 month program.
<br/>

We've spent the last 15 years studying 1,000+ startup resources, battle testing what works on own business, and compiling the best of the best.
<br/>

Other startup courses will tell you what to do on a high level. Athena.vc shows you exactly how to do it step by step.
